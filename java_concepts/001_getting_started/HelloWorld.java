/*
 * ******* Points to Remember ********
 * --> Java Intalled --> JDK (Java Development Kit) --> JRE (Java Runtime
 * Environment) + Development tools e.g. javac, java etc
 * --> JRE --> JVM (Java Virtual Machine) + Set of libraries + Other files
 * 
 * --> javac compiles code --> byte code (not os understandable)
 * --> JVM compiles this byte code to machine code --> OS understand
 * 
 * ===========================
 * When you install the Java Development Kit (JDK), it includes both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
 * --> The JRE provides the necessary libraries, Java class files, and other components to run Java applications, 
 * --> while the JVM is the virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. 
 * --> The JDK is a comprehensive development kit that includes tools, libraries, and executables for both development and execution of Java applications.
 * ===========================
 * 
 * --> Java is a case sensitive language like C and C++
 * --> Java is nearly 100% object oriented language
 * --> In java, it is not possible to make a function which is not a member of
 * any class
 * (as we can do in C++)

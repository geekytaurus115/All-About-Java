## Data Types in Java

### Definition

A type idenitifies a set of values (and their representation in memory) and a set of operations that transform these values into other values of that set.

- Java is strongly types language
- Two types of Data Types in Java
  - Primitive Data Types
  - Reference Data Types

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types represent simple values, and they are divided into two groups: numeric types and non-numeric types.

#### Numeric Types

##### Integral Types:

- `byte:` 8-bit signed integer. Memory: 1 byte.
- `short:` 16-bit signed integer. Memory: 2 bytes.
- `int:` 32-bit signed integer. Memory: 4 bytes.
- `long:` 64-bit signed integer. Memory: 8 bytes.

##### Floating-Point Types:

- `float:` 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Memory: 4 bytes.
- `double:` 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Memory: 8 bytes.

#### Non-Numeric Types:

- `char:` Represents a 16-bit Unicode character. Memory: 2 bytes.
- `boolean:` Represents a boolean value (true or false). Size is not precisely defined.
